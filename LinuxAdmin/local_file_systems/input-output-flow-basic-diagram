	APPLICATION Send I/O Request to the VFS
	   
		 
	VFS - It deals with all the different file systems ext4,xfs, etc\
	      Once it has addressed the I/O request it then sends the request to\
	      the page cache  and buffer case

       
        page cache - It sits between the VFS and the actual FileSystem. 
        
	
	bufferr cache points into the page cache  - I/O Requests are bufferred before\
						    passed on to the hardware\

    
        I\O Schedule  - It interacts with the driver of the storage device.\
			I/O schedulers exist as a way to optimize disk access requests.
			They traditionally do this by merging I/O requests to similar 
			locations on disk.
