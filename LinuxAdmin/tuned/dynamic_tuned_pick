You can set a tuneD profile that dynamically adjusts it self according to what the OS is doing. The tuneD service will start switching between profiles accordingly. To enable this do the following: 

  

#Edit the following file 

/etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf 

  

#Change value of following paramater to 1 

 dynamic_tuning = 1 

  

#Change Following value to suit your needs. 

# Update interval for dynamic tunings (in seconds). 

# It must be multiply of the sleep_interval. 

update_interval = 10
