 Tuned is a daemon which allows you to dynamically change the performance profile of your server. Once you isolate your core(s) then in systemD you can use “tasket -c” to specify which core a service/process will use. 

  

#TO ENABLE CPU ISOLATION 

yum-config-manager --enable rt 

yum install tuned tuned-profiles-realtime 

systemctl enable --now tuned 

  

#Insert following line, depending what cores you want to isolate. 

#in file /etc/tuned/realtime-variables.conf insert 

isolated_cores=0-1 

#and comment out  

isolated_cores=${f:calc_isolated_cores:1} 

  

#Enable the realtime tuned profile 

tuned-adm profile  realtime 

reboot 

  

#TO REVERT CHANGES 

#On file /etc/tuned/realtime-variables.conf 

#remove following line 

isolated_cores=0-1 

 

#Uncomment following line  

isolated_cores=${f:calc_isolated_cores:1} 

  

#You may have to change your tuned profile to another profile for this to take full affect 

 reboot
