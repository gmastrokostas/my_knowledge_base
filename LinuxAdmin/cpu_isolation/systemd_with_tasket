ystemd Process CPU assignment 

If you have a custom process you want to dedicate specific cores to it, you will have to configure 
its systemd file by requesting it to start with the taskset utility. See below.
However, if you need this set of cores to be fully dedicated to this specific service you will need 
to also isolate those cores. Otherwise, the specific process will run only on these cores plus whatever
other processes the kernels gives to these cores. 

  

  

[Service] 
#In the ExecStart parameter add the following, depending the cores you want to isolate 
ExecStart=/bin/taskset -c 0-2  /usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -DFOREGROUND 

  

#Restart your service 
systemctl restart httpd
