#Template Databases 
A newly created database is cloned by default by template1.
Templates contain views, functions etc which is part of the system catalog.
There are two templates. Template 1 and 0

#User Databases
Every database has an owner aka role  and a set of permissions associated with that role.

#Roles
Roles belong to the cluster and not to a specific database.
A role can either be a user or a group.
A role can be part of another role

#Tablespace
Is the storage location for the database.

#Schemas
Contains tables, views, functions etc. 
By default there is schema called public in the template1 database.
As a result when a new database is created it also contains by default the public schema.
